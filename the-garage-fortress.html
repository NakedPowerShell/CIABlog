Our driveway at the Plano Texas house was in the back and it led up to the two-car garage. But my conscientious Dad that secured the house every time we left had locked it. Except this time I was sure that he had done himself in.</p><p class="msg msg--info">He was his own worst enemy.</p><p>Once he discovered that he had no house keys on him, he walked up to the garage door, removed something from his shirt pocket, bent down just slightly, and inserted something into garage door lock. About 8 seconds later, the handle turned and the garage door slid up at his fingertips.<strong> I was dumbfounded</strong>. How did he open the garage <strong>without a key?</strong> He finally told me.<br><br>He habitually carried a open ended leather comb case with a metal comb in his shirt pocket. But next to the metal comb was two lock picks and a tension bar. The metal comb kept the picks from getting bent and held the picks in the case.<br><br>Turns out that he could open most <strong>American locks</strong> with just two types of picks and a tension bar. I asked how he picked the lock so fast. He said that the U.S. Treasury had trained him as an ATF agent to <strong>pick locks</strong> and that the Agency gave him even further training.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">He had picked thousands of locks over the years and many different types.</p><p>It was as natural to him to pick a lock as it was for me to turn a doorknob and walk in a room. And I had seen many movies and TV shows by that time that showed spies and criminals picking locks by crouching down and looking into the key way as they picked.<br><br>I asked why he <strong>did not do that crouching method</strong>. He said that he was trained to walk up to a door and pick it in the same amount of time and <strong>appearance as if he had a key</strong>. He could feel the pins in the key way with the pick and manipulate them at will. Most good locksmiths can pick locks but not in such an innocuous manner. When he was in the field, he did not want to give even the hint that he was picking a lock, because he would have <strong>drawn unnecessary attention to himself</strong>.<br><br>I asked the next logical question, were the lock picks <strong>illegal to own</strong> for a private citizen that was not a locksmith? (In the past)</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><strong>His answer was yes.</strong></p><p>But then he said how often would a police officer search his comb case since he had a clean criminal history and would not give the officer any reason to search him.</p><p>So I got to see a <strong>side of my Father</strong> in action, in his element, that I had not seen before.</p><p>Â </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 12, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/texas-living/">Texas</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnakedpowershell.github.io%2FCIABlog%2Fthe-garage-fortress.html&amp;via=nakedpowershell&amp;text=The%20Garage%20Fortress" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/frankfurt-bunker.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Frankfurt Bunker</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/scorpions-in-rome-italy.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Scorpions in Rome Italy</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/authors/dusty-r/" class="inverse" title="Dusty R">Dusty R</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/background.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/7/responsive/serpent-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/7/responsive/serpent-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Dust Cover of &quot;Serpent on the Hill&quot;"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/background.html" class="inverse">Background</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-06T02:47">June 6, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/light.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/5/responsive/david-van-dijk-255503-unsplash-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/5/responsive/david-van-dijk-255503-unsplash-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Lamp Light"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/light.html" class="inverse">Light Switch Conceal</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-04T12:04">June 4, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/million-dollar-baby.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/4/responsive/colin-watts-1169445-unsplash-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/4/responsive/colin-watts-1169445-unsplash-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Cash Stack"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/million-dollar-baby.html" class="inverse">Million Dollar Baby</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-04T10:57">June 4, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">(C) 2019 Copyright Dusty Rhodes, All Rights Reserved.
