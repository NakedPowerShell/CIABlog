He knew where we were going, so we get off at <strong>mysterious subway stop</strong>. We exit the subway, walk up the stairs to the surface streets, and then walk for 45 minutes, block after block.<br><br>My friend suddenly says, we are here, and points across the street to this strange clay colored mountain that takes up a whole square block.</p><p class="msg msg--info">The mount was huge by any standards.</p><p>The mount covered an area of 20,000 square meters (220,000 sq ft) at its base and with a volume of approximately 580,000 cubic meters (760,000 cu yd).

The pile grew each century exponentially to the <strong>height of 115 feet</strong> that it was that day.<br><br>My friend said it was time to dig, so we used our shovels to turn over piles of old pottery pieces, hoping for a <strong>collection of shards</strong> that we could <strong>reconstruct back into pot</strong>.</p><p class="msg msg--info">No luck. What we did find was thousands of black scorpions hiding from the sun under the cool clay pottery pieces.</p><p>I yelled to my friend to run and we did kind of a controlled run off the mount to street level. Once we got over that shock, we checked each other's clothes and hair in case scorpions hitched a ride. Thank goodness none were found.<br><br>So we made the<strong> long walk back</strong> to the subway entrance, caught a subway back to the main part of Rome, except we detoured to go to a restaurant that served American style food like hamburgers and milk shakes.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">This restaurant was located on a very popular tourist street with some jet setters and the like.</p><p>So we walk down this street in broad daylight, two American <strong>teenagers</strong> carrying shovels head to the place.<br><br>The restaurant has no tables, with a little stand up area, which is not unusual for Rome, because of the valuable real estate.<br><br>So we order out <strong>hamburgers and milk shakes and chow down</strong> while standing on the street, leaning against the wall. The food was amazing.<br><br>We then caught another subway to get to each of our homes.<br><br>It was <strong>Saturday</strong> and only my Mom and Brother were home, my Father was working, which was <strong>not unusual</strong> for a weekend.<br><br>My Father came home late for supper and right away he asks <strong>why I was walking on the ritzy street with a shovel.</strong><br><br>I was so stunned that he knew, that I could not lie and told him about my adventure.<br><br>He told me <strong>never do that again</strong>, to take shovels into town and walk around with them.<br><br>He also <strong>never told me how he knew.</strong></p><p class="msg msg--info">It took me like 20 years to figure out the puzzle.</p><p>Number one was that he did not want a <strong>CIA kid</strong> to bring attention to himself or the family in public.<br><br>Number two was that his work that Saturday was to help man an <strong>CIA Observation Post (OP)</strong> to watch that street and saw me and my friend with the shovels.<br><br>The Agency liked to monitor key important streets for VIP people, diplomats, foreign intelligence Agents, Embassy and Consulate employees, and many other <strong>"hot" targeted</strong> people.<br><br>The OP used various surveillance tools like binoculars, telescopes and the like to physically monitor people traffic.<br><br>Little did I know that I stumbled onto CIA surveillance.<br><br></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 12, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/italy/">Italy</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnakedpowershell.github.io%2FCIABlog%2Fscorpions-in-rome-italy.html&amp;via=nakedpowershell&amp;text=Scorpions%20in%20Rome%20Italy" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/the-garage-fortress.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">The Garage Fortress</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/authors/dusty-r/" class="inverse" title="Dusty R">Dusty R</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">(C) 2019 Copyright Dusty Rhodes, All Rights Reserved.
