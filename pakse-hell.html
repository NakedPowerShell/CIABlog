It has left Vientiane with passengers, stopped in Savannakhet to let people on and off, then off to Pakse, get passengers on and off, then back to Vientiane.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">The cargo airplanes of Air America never flew very high, so no need for a side door or pressurized cabin.</p><p>A few of the passengers that were already on the plane were a music band of a few young guys with long hair. They were headed to Pakse to play music there. On the flight from Savannakhet to Pakse, they would stand by the open back door while in flight and <strong>lean into the wind</strong> and look around.<br><br>I thought that one quick bank maneuver by the pilot and this kid would go out the door. This was the beginning of a very long and frightful day.<br><br>So none of us were prepared to fly into Pakse, which was at the time was a beehive of war activity.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pakse Laos</a><br><br>Pakse was in a very strategic geographic location to support the Secret War and the Vietnam War itself.<br><br>Airplanes out of Pakse could easily attack the <a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/watching-the-trail.html">Ho Chi Minh Trail (HCMT)</a>, enemy troops in Southern and Central Laos, or enemy troops in Vietnam.<br><br>As our plane approached the Pakse "airport", we flew pretty low and were dodging mountains. Suddenly the wings on the plane began to wiggle violently and we slammed onto the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marston_Mat">PSP (Marsden) steel planking</a> runway, taxied over near some military fighter planes and parked. The entire "airport" was built with PSP.</p><figure class="post__image post__image"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/23/responsive/1024px-Tuskagee_MarsdenMatting-xs.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/23/responsive/1024px-Tuskagee_MarsdenMatting-xs.jpg 300w ,https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/23/responsive/1024px-Tuskagee_MarsdenMatting-sm.jpg 480w ,https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/23/responsive/1024px-Tuskagee_MarsdenMatting-md.jpg 768w ,https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/23/responsive/1024px-Tuskagee_MarsdenMatting-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="332nd Fighter Group pilots discuss combat flying.

Walking on Marsden matting.during WWII</figcaption></figure><p>The band exited the plane and ran across the airfield with a armed escort to a building in the distance. That was one tough gig to play at I bet.<br><br>Once the band had left we got very strict and stern instructions <strong>NOT to leave the airplane</strong> while we sat on the ground for awhile.<br><br>So we looked out the windows and missing door to see chaos in action. Trucks racing about, military planes and Air America planes and helicopters taking on munitions and fuel. Military and CIA contract airplane crews running about. [story of Ravens]<br><br>The big lie was that officially there were no US military soldiers in Laos, since it was neutral. [story]<br><br>Finally the pilot fired up the engines, we taxied out to the main runway and took off at a steep angle, with the wings wiggling again.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">We made it back safely to Vientiane with any more incidents.</p><p>The whole story of what had happened was not explained to me until years later.<br><br><strong>Enemy snipers, either Pathet Lao (PL), Vietcong (VC), or North Vietnamese Army (NVA) were very active at the airport the day we flew into Pakse.</strong><br><br>The snipers sat in the deep jungle at the end of the runway and took shots at the American airplanes as they came to land, because when landing a plane, the sniper knows where to zero in their <strong>telescopic sight</strong>.<br><br>I do not recall hearing any gunshots landing or taking off. But maybe it did happen, I will never know.<br><br>So the avoidance technique by the pilot was:<br><br>* Approach from a low angle behind mountains<br>* Dive quickly to the runway<br>* Wiggle the wings to distract the snipers and change course slightly<br><br>I think not knowing at the time did help some.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 8, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/ciaplanes/">CIA Aircraft</a></li><li><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/laos/">Laos</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnakedpowershell.github.io%2FCIABlog%2Fpakse-hell.html&amp;via=nakedpowershell&amp;text=Pakse%20Hell" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/the-cia-nurses-and-me.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">The CIA Nurses and I</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/authors/dusty-r/" class="inverse" title="Dusty R">Dusty R</a></h3></div></div><div class="post__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/why-laos-stories-mostly.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/21/responsive/738px-Laos_Regions_Map-xs.png" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/21/responsive/738px-Laos_Regions_Map-xs.png" data-expand="300" alt="Why Laos All the Time"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/why-laos-stories-mostly.html" class="inverse">Why Laos Stories Mostly</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-07T19:25">June 7, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/laos-cia-milk-run.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/20/responsive/32-1-xs.jpg" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/20/responsive/32-1-xs.jpg" data-expand="300" alt="Air America CIA Airlines Milk Run"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/laos-cia-milk-run.html" class="inverse">Laos CIA Milk Run</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-07T14:44">June 7, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/air-amercia-cia.html"><img class="lazyload" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/19/responsive/1024px-Air_America_wings.svg-xs.png" data-srcset="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/19/responsive/1024px-Air_America_wings.svg-xs.png" data-expand="300" alt="Air America Airlines Badge"></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/air-amercia-cia.html" class="inverse">Air Amercia : CIA</a></h4><time datetime="2019-06-07T13:54">June 7, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">(C) 2019 Copyright Dusty Rhodes, All Rights Reserved.
