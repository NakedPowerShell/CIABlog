The government taxes all alcohol and they want their cut, hence the name - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/revenuers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Definition of the word Revenuers">Revenuers</a>.</p><p>Trying to catch a shiner was a game of cat and mouse.  They hid their stills deep in the mountains on roads that were not on a map.  They would also buy a decrepit old car and put a Cadillac engine into it along with a large stainless steel tank in the trunk to hold the moonshine.  If my Dad was working the back roads of North Carolina and came upon a suspected shiner driving, the race was on and most the time they won.  He had to build up an intelligence network to discover where the stills were hidden.</p><p>My Dad used to carry sticks of dynamite in the trunk of his car to blow up the stills.  This was the old fashion kind of dynamite that sweated nitroglycerin, making it very unstable.</p><p>One time he located a large still near a shiners house and placed his dynamite at the base of the large copper kettles.  He discovered that he used too much dynamite and the kettles ignited like rockets going to the Moon but instead they flew high in the sky towards the house of the shiner.  When they landed they exploded in a giant fireball, barely missing the house.</p><p>He was very happy that he did not have to write a Dear Director letter explaining why he blew up a citizen’s house.</p><p>To be sneaky the shiners would drive by our house and see if my Dad’s car was home.  If it was they knew it was safe to make a run.</p><p>My Mother was not too happy because I used to play out in the front yard as a kid and here were these criminals hanging around, putting us under surveillance.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 6, 2019</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/north-carolina/">North Carolina</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnakedpowershell.github.io%2FCIABlog%2Fchasing-moonshine.html&amp;via=nakedpowershell&amp;text=Chasing%20Moonshine" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/mekong-river.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Mekong River</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/good-shooting-snoopy.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Good Shooting Snoopy</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/authors/dusty-r/" class="inverse" title="Dusty R">Dusty R</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">(C) 2019 Copyright Dusty Rhodes, All Rights Reserved.
