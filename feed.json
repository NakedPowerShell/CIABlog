He knew where we were going, so we get off at <strong>mysterious subway stop</strong>. We exit the subway, walk up the stairs to the surface streets, and then walk for 45 minutes, block after block.<br><br>My friend suddenly says, we are here, and points across the street to this strange clay colored mountain that takes up a whole square block.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">The mount was huge by any standards.</p>\n<p>The mount covered an area of 20,000 square meters (220,000 sq ft) at its base and with a volume of approximately 580,000 cubic meters (760,000 cu yd). It had a circumference of nearly a kilometer (0.6 mi) and stands 35 meters (115 ft) high.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><img src=\"https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/27/pottery.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Testaccio - Mount of Pottery\" width=\"1280\" height=\"724\">\n<figcaption >Monte Testaccio - Mount of Pottery</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">My friend said CLIMB!</p>\n<p>So we slowly climbed up this mount, and I <strong>cannot identify</strong> what we are walking on, but each footstep you heard a crunch.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">It turns out to be an estimated 53 million broken pottery, used to carry oil for lamps.</p>\n<p>This <strong>entire street block</strong> was just a enormous mountain of clay pottery pieces.<br><br>I had never heard of this place.<br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Testaccio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monte Testaccio</a><br><br><br>After a lot of climbing we got to the top and the entire mount back in 1969 was just like it was back in 140 BC. The pile grew each century exponentially to the <strong>height of 115 feet</strong> that it was that day.<br><br>My friend said it was time to dig, so we used our shovels to turn over piles of old pottery pieces, hoping for a <strong>collection of shards</strong> that we could <strong>reconstruct back into pot</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">No luck. What we did find was thousands of black scorpions hiding from the sun under the cool clay pottery pieces.</p>\n<p>I yelled to my friend to run and we did kind of a controlled run off the mount to street level. Once we got over that shock, we checked each other's clothes and hair in case scorpions hitched a ride. Thank goodness none were found.<br><br>So we made the<strong> long walk back</strong> to the subway entrance, caught a subway back to the main part of Rome, except we detoured to go to a restaurant that served American style food like hamburgers and milk shakes.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">This restaurant was located on a very popular tourist street with some jet setters and the like.</p>\n<p>So we walk down this street in broad daylight, two American <strong>teenagers</strong> carrying shovels head to the place.<br><br>The restaurant has no tables, with a little stand up area, which is not unusual for Rome, because of the valuable real estate.<br><br>So we order out <strong>hamburgers and milk shakes and chow down</strong> while standing on the street, leaning against the wall. The food was amazing.<br><br>We then caught another subway to get to each of our homes.<br><br>It was <strong>Saturday</strong> and only my Mom and Brother were home, my Father was working, which was <strong>not unusual</strong> for a weekend.<br><br>My Father came home late for supper and right away he asks <strong>why I was walking on the ritzy street with a shovel.</strong><br><br>I was so stunned that he knew, that I could not lie and told him about my adventure.<br><br>He told me <strong>never do that again</strong>, to take shovels into town and walk around with them.<br><br>He also <strong>never told me how he knew.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">It took me like 20 years to figure out the puzzle.</p>\n<p>Number one was that he did not want a <strong>CIA kid</strong> to bring attention to himself or the family in public.<br><br>Number two was that his work that Saturday was to help man an <strong>CIA Observation Post (OP)</strong> to watch that street and saw me and my friend with the shovels.<br><br>The Agency liked to monitor key important streets for VIP people, diplomats, foreign intelligence Agents, Embassy and Consulate employees, and many other <strong>\"hot\" targeted</strong> people.<br><br>The OP used various surveillance tools like binoculars, telescopes and the like to physically monitor people traffic.<br><br>Little did I know that I stumbled onto CIA surveillance.<br><br></p>",

Our driveway at the Plano Texas house was in the back and it led up to the two-car garage. But my conscientious Dad that secured the house every time we left had locked it. Except this time I was sure that he had done himself in.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">He was his own worst enemy.</p>\n<p>Once he discovered that he had no house keys on him, he walked up to the garage door, removed something from his shirt pocket, bent down just slightly, and inserted something into garage door lock. About 8 seconds later, the handle turned and the garage door slid up at his fingertips.<strong> I was dumbfounded</strong>. How did he open the garage <strong>without a key?</strong> He finally told me.<br><br>He habitually carried a open ended leather comb case with a metal comb in his shirt pocket. But next to the metal comb was two lock picks and a tension bar. The metal comb kept the picks from getting bent and held the picks in the case. <br><br>Turns out that he could open most <strong>American locks</strong> with just two types of picks and a tension bar. I asked how he picked the lock so fast. He said that the U.S. Treasury had trained him as an ATF agent to <strong>pick locks</strong> and that the Agency gave him even further training.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">He had picked thousands of locks over the years and many different types.</p>\n<p>It was as natural to him to pick a lock as it was for me to turn a doorknob and walk in a room. And I had seen many movies and TV shows by that time that showed spies and criminals picking locks by crouching down and looking into the key way as they picked. <br><br>I asked why he <strong>did not do that crouching method</strong>. He said that he was trained to walk up to a door and pick it in the same amount of time and <strong>appearance as if he had a key</strong>. He could feel the pins in the key way with the pick and manipulate them at will. Most good locksmiths can pick locks but not in such an innocuous manner. When he was in the field, he did not want to give even the hint that he was picking a lock, because he would have <strong>drawn unnecessary attention to himself</strong>.<br><br>I asked the next logical question, were the lock picks <strong>illegal to own</strong> for a private citizen that was not a locksmith? (In the past)</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>His answer was yes. </strong></p>\n<p>But then he said how often would a police officer search his comb case since he had a clean criminal history and would not give the officer any reason to search him.</p>\n<p>So I got to see a <strong>side of my Father</strong> in action, in his element, that I had not seen before.</p>\n<p> </p>",
