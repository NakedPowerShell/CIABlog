He specialized in many of the electronic tradecrafts that the CIA uses.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"> “I see you’re working on spacecraft electronics, have practical experience in construction, and have even run your own fabrication and design business,” he said, checking off items on my sixteen-page application. “There might be a TOPS assignment for you in a few years.” I later realized that Glenn was assessing my potential for what was known as a more exciting “singleton” assignment overseas—the forward deployment of tech ops (technical operations) officers as TSD firemen. They were expected to fly in on short notice and provide the technical support that case officers might need in a fast-breaking operation, perhaps in a remote area.<br><br>Mendez, Antonio J..

Special devices could include listening devices (bugs), video or camera devices, surveillance devices, disguises, and forged documents.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">I would soon learn more about the TOPS program, which assigned certain qualified TSD officers overseas to work side-by-side with their case officer colleagues. For example, a case officer might be skilled or lucky enough to recruit an agent willing to plant a listening device in the desk drawer of a sensitive department of a foreign government. Building the device and training the agent in its use were the TSD officer’s jobs. TOPS officers could handle most urgent jobs, but they knew when to ask for help.<br><br>Mendez, Antonio J..

This kind of assignment only went to officers with a lot of training and guts. Some of his assignments were to travel to a foreign country and at night "break" into a consulate or embassy. Once inside the building they would, for example, open locked crypto safes and take pictures of documents, drill small holes and place a listening device, covering the hole, and do other clandestine tasks.</p><p>Objective one was not to get caught and second was to not leave any trace behind that your team was there.</p><p>Antonio Mendez (Tony) was a TOPS officer also around the time my father was active.
