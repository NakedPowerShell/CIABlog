<p><br>This was the flag of Laos from 1952-1975. Laos had a huge population of elephants that they used as a construction vehicle like the West uses a John Deere tractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Country of Laos</a><br><br>Laos is a land locked, poor country that was a springboard for CIA operations during the Vietnam War. The Agency built the largest private airline in the world to support the “Secret War”. That airline was called Air America (AA). It predecessor was Civil Air Transport (CAT) Airlines. <br><br>The Agency also hired and supplied a mercenary army of about 30,000 troops and used them to attack and harass the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail (HCMT) and the Communist troops that used Laos and Cambodia as a sanctuary. The Communists recruited indigenous people of Laos and they were called Pathet Lao (PL). <br><br>The country of Laos is approximated the size of Utah and is mostly mountains and plateaus. The climate is tropical, with a rainy season from May to November and the dry season from December to April. It floods about 6 feet every seven years, so the local villagers build their huts on 9-10 foot stilts.<br><br>We were stationed in <strong>Vientiane</strong>, the capital, for two long years, from 1968-1969. This time period was the height of the battles in Vietnam, B-52 bombings, and misery in Southeast Asia (SEA).<br><br>For an excellent article about Air America (AA) in Laos, please click on this link Supporting the <br><br>"Secret War": CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974. <br><br>This article on the CIA web site by William M. Leary, in the Studies in Intelligence section, gives an informative history of Air America (AA) and its predecessor Civil Air Transport (CAT).<br><br></p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dcmnqga70">A short list of words and meanings that are commonly referred to in this blog</h2>
<p> This is where I attempt to define much of the slang and abbreviations that I use in the blog. Most of the slang is commonly used in the Intelligence field.<br><br><strong>Air America (AA)</strong> - An airline front company for the CIA.<br><br>AA took over the task from CAT of supplying materials and transporting "special" passengers in Laos during the Secret War.<br><br>Air America Homepage<br><br><strong>Agency, The</strong> - Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)<br><br>A common slang word used when talking with other Intelligence agents.<br><br><strong>Back Stop</strong> - A very plausible job, telephone number, or address.<br><br>When a pseudonym for an agent is created, sometimes a back stopped identity has to be created. If an enemy agent suspects the agent's background and he checks on where he works, the back stop will be good enough to fool him into thinking that his suspicions were false.<br><br><a href="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5827/676/1600/0000106269_0001.gif"><img src="https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5827/676/320/0000106269_0001.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>Cable from Station in Laos<br><br><br><strong>Cable </strong>- A secure message.<br><br>Before there was email, the CIA used cables to communicate between Stations and HQ. Cables were condensed and concise messages, sort of like telegrams, where you are concerned about using too many words.<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</strong> - The government agency responsible for overseas Intelligence gathering using Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and sometimes Electronic Intelligence (ELINT).<br><br>Central Intelligence Agency<br><br><strong>Civil Air Transport (CAT)</strong> - An airline front company for the CIA.<br><br>The predecessor to Air America (AA) in Laos.<br><br><strong>Code Name</strong> - Alias for an agent<br><br>Similar to an pseudonym, a code name is an alias for an agent. Code names were used when the pseudonym is not to be revealed. The double agent FBI man Robert Hanssen's code name was "Ramon". When he communicated with his KGB handlers, "Ramon" was what he was known as. Also known as Cover Name.<br><br><strong>Company, The</strong> - Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)<br><br>A common slang word used to obscure the meaning when talking around non Intelligence agents.<br><br><strong>Cover Story</strong> - A semi plausible story to protect the true identify of the agent.<br><br>A typical cover story for an agent traveling overseas is that he is working for a company that sells electronic parts.<br><br><strong>Forward Air Controller (FAC)</strong> - A spotter in a forward area.<br><br>They loitered in the area of the enemy, by land, air, or sea, sometimes marking it with flare rockets if the FAC is airborne, so that fighters and bombers could hit their targets accurately. A highly dangerous job, especially considering that the Ravens used low and slow propeller driven aircraft.<br><br><strong>Front Company</strong> - A legitimate company to conceal Intelligence activities.<br><br>One of the more famous front companies was Air America (AA), which at its height in Laos was the largest private airline in the world. Intelligence agencies use front companies to help provide personnel and material support to a secret operation without drawing attention to itself including from the press and citizens.<br><br><strong>Ho Chi Minh Trail (HCMT)</strong> - A large number of trails and roads that the Communists used to supply their war effort and infiltrate.<br><br>The word trail is actually a misnomer, since the HCMT was a large network of paths, roads, and trails. The HCMT started in North Vietnam (NVN) and winded through Laos and Cambodia and into South Vietnam (SVN).<br><br><strong>Laos </strong>- A country in Southeast Asia (SEA)<br><br>Laos is a land locked, poor country that was a springboard for CIA operations during the Vietnam War.<br><br><br><br>Map of Laos pre 1974<br><br><strong>Merc </strong>- Short for Mercenary<br><br>A non-military person that is for hire, and that specializes in hazardous assignments. Also known as a Contractor. Usually has a military background, especially with some type of Special Forces, like Army Rangers, Green Berets, Airborne, Air Commandos, Navy SEALS, or Marine RECON. Mercenaries that were used in Laos came from a wide range of countries in SEA.<br><br><strong>Microdot</strong> - A miniature picture the size of the head of a pin.<br><br>Microdots are shrunken pictures that can be transported underneath a postage stamp on a letter. The agent receiving the microdots has a microdot viewer that enlarges the picture so that it is readable. Microdots can also be hidden in-between the layers of a book binding and any where else that one can imagine.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Microfilm</strong> - Very small picture film.<br><br>Microfilm can be used in miniature cameras and easily transported or concealed. A Minox is a type of microfilm camera.<br><br><br><br>Minox Camera<br><br><strong>National Security Agency (NSA)</strong> - The government agency tasked with making codes, breaking foreign government codes, and intercepting Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Photographic Intelligence (PHOTINT), and Communications Intelligence (COMINT) overseas. The technical term for codes is cryptography. They are also involved in Information Systems Security (INFOSEC), to help protect U.S. government computer systems from foreign governments.<br><br>National Security Agency<br><br><strong>NVA</strong> - North Vietnamese Army<br><br>The formal Communist forces of North Vietnam. They had actual uniforms and had formal military formations and training. This is in contrast to the VC which did not have official uniforms and formations.<br><br><strong>NVN</strong> - North Vietnam<br><br><strong>PL</strong> - Pathet Lao<br><br>The Communist Laotians who fought against the CIA and American friendly forces. Contrary to what you read on the Internet, The PL did not win the war in Laos, they took over by default after we withdrew at the end of the Vietnam war.<br><br><strong>Pseudonym </strong>- A fake name and identity<br><br>When an agent is in the field, many times he has one or more pseudonyms that he uses. A pseudonym within the Intelligence world is written LAST NAME, first name, with the last name in all caps. The reason for this is that when you are reading a document that has names in it, you know if it is a true name or a pseudonym.<br><br><strong>Ravens, The</strong> - An unofficial group of pilots that served in Laos<br><br>They flew high risk missions in Laos to rescue downed pilots of AA and CAT, do surveillance of the HCMT, and acted as Forward Air Controllers (FAC) so that fighters and bombers could hit their targets accurately. All the members of the Ravens were sheep dipped, for plausible deniability.<br><br>Raven FAC Homepage<br><br><strong>SEA</strong> - Southeast Asia<br><br>Includes Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia.<br><br><strong>Secret War</strong> - The undeclared war in Laos<br><br>The so called "Secret War" in Laos was the CIA's attempt to disrupt and harass the PL, NVA, and VC.<br><br>Secret War in Laos<br><br><strong>Secret Writing</strong> - Methods of concealing messages in plain sight<br><br>Agents in the field use secret writing to communicate with other agents. Typically secret writing uses some sort of gimmick to conceal the message, like an invisible ink. The hidden message is written in the margins of an ordinary letter and then sent to the agent of choice. The receiving agent has a chemical that he wipes on the letter to reveal the secret message.<br><br><strong>Sheep Dipped</strong> - Change of job or duties<br><br>Sometimes agents change jobs to other non-intelligence agencies or military assignments so that they cannot be traced back to their source agency.<br><br><strong>Sterilized</strong> - Non traceable back to the source agency.<br><br>Many times weapons and airplanes have their serial numbers removed or paperwork "lost" so that they are not traceable back to the source agency. The CIA also purchased material from the open market using front companies so that it could not be traced back.<br><br><strong>SVN</strong> - South Vietnam<br><br><strong>Tradecraft</strong> - The methods and techniques of Intelligence agents.<br><br>For example, surveillance of an enemy agent is a tradecraft.<br><br><strong>True Name</strong> - The actual real name of the agent<br><br>True names are a closely guarded secret and therefore pseudonyms and code names are used extensively to protect it. It is standard procedure to never write the true name and the pseudonym or and code name in the same message or memo. This is done in case an enemy agency intercepts and decodes the message, they will not be able to connect the dots unless they have both messages.<br><br><strong>TSD</strong> - Technical Services Division of the CIA<br><br>The division of the CIA that created many of the gadgets for field and case agents. This is the division my Father worked for. <br><br><strong>VC</strong> - Viet Cong<br><br>The irregular Communist forces in and around Vietnam. Many wore black pajamas and operated only at night. This contrasts with the NVA which had uniforms and operated like a formal army. Many of the VC were farmers during the day, and then conducted military raids during the night. The movies blur the line between VC and NVA, but they were very different in how they operated but with the same objective.</p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dcmjljpd1">Hunting for the Vietcong Highway</h2>
<p><br>One of my Dad’s tasks in Laos was to assist the <strong>National Security Agency (NSA)</strong> and military intelligence with electronic monitoring of the <strong>Ho Chi Minh Trail (HCMT)</strong>. The Trail was a series of long paths, trails and roads that the Communists used to supply their war effort and infiltrate. Much of the Trail was small footpaths that a single worker or enemy solider would carry what he could hundreds of miles on foot. Some of cargo was carried on bicycles, oxen, carts, and occasionally a vehicle.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16.0pt;"> </p>
<p class="msg msg--info" style="margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 16.0pt;">Every year from 1967 onward, Hanoi had moved another <strong>100,000</strong> NVA replacements down the Trail and into South Vietnam. </p>

<p>On the Trail, devices like this were dropped into the jungle to count larger vehicles and even elephants.</p>

<p> The word trail is actually a misnomer, since the HCMT was a large network of paths, roads, and trails. The HCMT started in North Vietnam (NVN) and winded through Laos and Cambodia and into South Vietnam (SVN). In effect the Trail help supply the enemy with supplies, weapons, ammunition, and fresh troops.</p>

<p>It was composed of three parts: strings of air-dropped acoustic and seismic sensors collected intelligence on the trail; computers at the Intelligence Collection Center (ICS) in Thailand collated the information and predicted convoy paths and speeds; and an airborne relay and control aircraft which received the signals from the sensors and routed aircraft to targets as directed by the ISC.</p>
<p>My Father helped get some of the <strong>sensors developed</strong> and deployed from the air. He had to travel to various countries to work with vendors to build these complicated instruments based upon technology of 1968.</p>

<p>From this intelligence, strike missions for bombing the HCMT were planned and executed. Bases like Udorn Thailand [story] were used to damage the Trail, using B-52’s, F-4’s, and F-105’s.</p>

<p id="pragma-line-3">This online blog about the CIA is like no other. It details the bizarre behavior of my parents during and after the time that they both worked for the <strong><a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</a>.</strong></p>
<p id="pragma-line-5">Written from the perspective of a young man inside this family, watching the world around me. Imagine your Father being a top secret spy and your Mom is an administrative CIA employee that handles <strong>super classified documents</strong>. As a family, we traveled extensively and met a wide range of Spies, Diplomats, and Mercenaries.</p>

<br>This book is a tribute to my Father and Mother's dedication to preserving our way of life through their service in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). <br><br>As it turns out, my Mother also worked for the CIA, as a administrative employee and cable writer (early type of email) in Vientiane Laos. <br><br>My Father joined the Marines, graduated from law school, and then served with the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) as a United States Treasury Federal Agent chasing bootleggers and conducting surveillance of mobsters. [story]<br><br>Then he joined the CIA during a very turbulent time of our history when Soviet and Chinese threats were all about. Because of his previous training from ATF and interest in electronics and lock picking, he was assigned to CIA/TSD, or <strong>Technical Services Division</strong>, which did most of the stuff like “Q” did in the James Bond™ movies. This included providing espionage equipment and Tradecraft services that were required for CIA Stations all over the world. [story]<br><br>We lived in Fairfax Virginia, Frankfurt Germany, Vientiane Laos, and Rome Italy during his CIA career. My father traveled to five continents, applying his expertise, and when he retired he wrote a fictional book about two CIA agents.

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dchvhcoc0">Secret Messages</h2>
<div id="MainContent">
<h3 id="secret-messages">Before email existed, the CIA used a communication system called a Cable.</h3>
<p id="pragma-line-5">The cable system was a secure method of typing email like letters and sending them to other classified cable users around the world.</p>
<p id="pragma-line-7">The actual cable writing machine looked like a teletype machine. Except that the cable writing machine sent encrypted data so that the Russians, Chinese, and other hostile countries could not read our communications traffic.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://nakedpowershell.github.io/CIABlog/media/posts/6/teletype.jpg" alt="teletype" width="768" height="1024"></p>
</div>
<p> The format of a cable is the following:<br><br>* Classification: Unclassified, Classified, Secret, Top Secret, NOFORN, Special Keywords<br>* Priority: Regular, Priority, Immediate, Flash<br>* Tracking and Header Information<br>* Date and Time<br>* Subject Title<br>* Cable From<br>* Cable To<br>* Special Handling Notes<br>* Sources<br>* The Body of the Message<br><br>I know about FLASH messages because of the my friendship with Joe Meadors (USS Liberty) [story]<br><br>And the USS Liberty story gets more interesting when I met a Navy SEAL that was tasked to help stabilize the USS Liberty ship after the attack. [story]<br><br>The responsibility of crafting a cable eventually came down to CIA administrative people like my Mother. <br><br>How my Mother got the opportunity for the job is an interesting story in itself.
