                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dcqhho4p1">The CIA Nurses and I Went to War</h2>
<p>To prepare for moving to SEA (Southeast Asia), <strong>Laos</strong> specifically, the family got vaccinations at the <strong>CIA Headquarters, Langley Virginia</strong>.<br><br>Because Laos is relatively primitive with no health standard and has lots of jungles, a laundry list of vaccinations are needed, twice before you depart.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Many diseases that do not exist in the United States do exist in Laos.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, here is a partial list of vaccinations we had to get:<br><br>* Typhoid<br>* Typhus<br>* Hepatitis A <br>* Plague #1<br>* Plague #2<br>* Japanese Encephalitis<br>* Malaria<br><br>Add all of that to the standard vaccinations you must get too.<br><br>One of the vaccinations was especially awful. It was the <strong>Gamma Globulin (GG)</strong> that had to be kept in the fridge until just before the nurse injects it into your hip.<br><br>The needle is a very large gauge and having it<strong> sunk into your hip</strong> was super painful. The serum is extra thick and the nurse has to really push it into your side. It seems like it takes minutes to her to finish, just my perception of this hellish procedure.<br><br>As a kid with no warning from the nurse as to what to expect, she just <strong>jammed the needle into my side</strong> and pushed like she had somewhere else to go.<br><br>That GG shot traumatized me and I got a real fear of needles after that.<br><br>Let me <strong>restart this story</strong> by telling you this.<br><br>The first time I walked across the CIA Seal with the eagle in tile on the floor, I asked my Father what did the letters spell, and he just shuffled me along and did not say anything.</p>

</figure>
<p>The nurses at CIA were old, experienced nurses that spent years working with the military, giving vaccinations to soldiers, and they were very crusty if you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">The CIA nurses had ZERO bedside manners or patience for kids.</p>
<p>So a visit to their medical office was like, sit in that room and wait, they walk in, get the vaccinations ready, slam them into your arms and legs (or hips), and then they leave. No hello or goodbye or idle chitchat.<br><br>Suddenly for our second visit we switched to the State Department medical offices for vaccinations.<br><br>I think the CIA finally realized that they were not helping Agents maintain their cover by having the family inside the CIA HQ.<br><br>The State Department had much more experience with giving kids vaccinations, so that was a huge relief.<br><br>Part of my nightmare was over but little did I know what was coming to our family while in Laos.</p>

<p><a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/19" title="Air America" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air America (AA)</a> flew regular scheduled flights to transport food, fresh milk, cargo, ammo, and people (Diplomats, CIA, <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheep Dipped Soldiers</a>, and Nurses) around Laos and Thailand.<br><br>The daily flights from Vientiane to Bangkok Thailand and back were such a common place event that it became known as the "Milk Run", as in going to the store to get milk. AA and CIA flippantly called it the 50 Kip, Kip being the local money and 50 Kip at the time was worth ten cents.</p>

<p><br><br>Laos did not produce good cows milk so it had to be daily imported from Bangkok. Even the Thai milk was not great compared to American dairies. [story]<br><br>The airplanes that AA used for the Milk Run were old WWII transport aircraft like the DC-3 and C-47. But they were always missing the side doors since the airplane was a work horse and did double duty dropping rice and cargo by parachute, so the doors would get in the way.</p>

<p>The aircraft Load Master aka Kicker (Guy that pushed cargo out the door with attached parachutes) needed a door free from obstacles. The aircraft also had a cord running down the top of the ceiling, to clip on the cargo packages to.</p>

<p>The term Milk Run and 50 Kip were a bit of an inside baseball terms that was only used by the CIA people in the field. On a commercial flight (Royal Air Lao) out of Vientiane on our way out of the country, I accidentally said something about this flight will be true luxury compared to the 50 Kip flight. <br><br>My Mom turned white because I could have blown our cover, so she very discretely told me to be quiet. It was not until we got to Hawaii that I realized that the Milk Run / 50 Kip linkage would have been bad.</p>
<p>50 Kip Flight = CIA</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>I had to learn how to maintain cover and never reveal too much.</p>
<p>It was life and death for many people, not a video game that you could restart with no consequences.</p>
<p>This was a big burden for a 12 year old.</p>

<p>Air America (AA) was a large private airline that was owned by the CIA. AA flew a large variety of special aircraft into very dangerous situations, carrying food like bags of rice, people ( both civilians and "customers i.e. CIA" ), medical supplies, ammo, fuel, and animals like oxen, pigs, and chickens.</p>

<p>AA was like a taxi and cargo service on demand for any CIA people or operation.</p>
<p>Some of the Aircraft they flew were STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) aircraft. They are extremely handy at landing on tiny runways in the jungle and taking back off.</p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dcnfm40t0">Good Shooting Snoopy, You Got the Red Barron said a CIA cable<br><br>The quote from a cable from the Director of the CIA at the time, William (Bill) Colby to Air America in Laos</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(airline)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air America (airline)</a> was used by the CIA and US government covertly to conduct military operations, posing as a civilian air carrier, in areas the US armed forces could not go due to treaty restraints contained in the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Accords. This was especially true for Laos. But both sides looked away and publicly denied having <strong>uniformed troops</strong> in Laos.</p>
<p>Air America  (AA) was the <strong>air taxi</strong> for the CIA's "<strong>Secret War in Laos</strong>". They transported everything, from people, food supplies, arms, ammo, live pigs and chickens, fuel, rice, medical supplies, and the list goes on. After a while, it was not such a secret war. AA flew helicopters, STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) aircraft, transport aircraft, and more.</p>
<p>In August 1966, to support the escalating air war against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), a Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) station was first constructed on the mountain above Lima Site (for landing site) 85 in Laos by the CIA. A TACAN station allows fighter planes and bombers to fly in bad weather and help guide them to their targets more accurately and more safely. Plowing into a mountain during zero visibility is a really bad way to end your career.</p>
<p>On 12 January 1968, four North Vietnamese Air Force <strong>AN-2 Colt biplanes</strong> lifted off from an airfield in northeastern North Vietnam and headed west toward Laos. The aircraft were on a mission to destroy a US radar base that was guiding bombers in attacks against targets in North Vietnam. Known to the Americans as Site 85, the radar facility was perched atop a 5,800-foot high mountain, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phou_Pha_Thi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phou Pha Thi</a>. Manned by US Air Force volunteers “sheep dipped” as employees of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, the site had been in operation only a few months. The mountain, used for many years as a staging base for CIA-directed Hmong guerilla fighters and American special operations and rescue helicopters, was only 125 nautical miles from Hanoi. Air America, a CIA-proprietary, provided aerial support for the facility, the technicians, and the security forces.</p>
<p>The Colts reached Site 85 early in the afternoon, and two began bombing and strafing passes as the others circled nearby. Coincidentally, Air America captain Ted Moore, flying a UH-1D Huey helicopter carrying ammunition to the site, saw the attack</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">“It looked like World War I,” he recalled.</p>
<p>and gave chase to a Colt as it turned back to the Vietnamese border. Moore positioned his helicopter above the biplane, as crewman Glenn Woods fired an AK-47 rifle down on it. The pursuit continued for more than 20 minutes until the second AN-2 flew underneath the helicopter. Dropping back, Moore and Woods watched as the first AN-2 dropped and crashed into a ridge just west of the North Vietnamese border. Minutes later, the second Colt hit the side of a mountain three miles farther north. The other Colts escaped, inactive observers throughout. Within hours a CIA-controlled ground team reached the crashed aircraft and found bullet holes in the downed planes.</p>
<p>In the mists of the Annamite Mountains and part of a secret war, Air America employees Ted Moore and Glenn Woods gained the distinction of having shot down a fixed-wing aircraft from a helicopter, a singular aerial victory in the Vietnam War. Two months later, North Vietnamese commandos attacked and destroyed Site 85, inflicting the deadliest single ground loss of US Air Force personnel of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>On 27 July 2007, CIA officially received An Air Combat First in an event attended by members of the Air America Board; pilot Ted Moore; Sawang Reed, the wife of flight mechanic Glenn Woods; CIA paramilitary legend Bill Lair; and the donors of the painting, former Air America officers Marius Burke and Boyd D. Mesecher.</p>
<p>The painting depicted above tells the tale of the Air America helicopter shooting at one of the North Vietnamese biplanes, on loan from Russia.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is CIA legend. When DCI (Director of CIA) Bill Colby heard the news from the CIA Station in Vientiane Laos of the defense of LS 85 and the shoot down of two biplanes by Air America personnel in a helicopter, he then wrote a cable (like a secure email) back with basically this message:</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Good shooting Snoopy, you got the Red Barron.</p>
<p>Colby was referring to the "Peanuts" comic strip where Snoopy was always flying his dog house and trying to shoot down an unseen enemy. In this case the Red Barron was the Russians / North Vietnamese / Communists.</p>
<p>My Father told me about this cable and the incident and it was so remarkable I remembered it for a long time.</p>
<p>Site 85 was then targeted for destruction by the North Vietnamese after the planes were shot down and over the coming weeks and months Site 85 was attacked, destroying the outpost, killing many Hmong soldiers and 11 Americans. The US Embassy called for an evacuation, it was too little and too late. It turned into a cluster fudge.</p>
<p>Colby retired from the Agency, wrote a book, and then went on a book tour. The book tour came to my city and Colby did a local talk show to promote the book and was talking questions live on the air.</p>
<p>He talked about his various experiences in the Agency and when the subject of CIA agents going rogue and defecting came up, he said it was highly unlikely since the Agency kept good tabs on current and former agents. Well that statement got me pretty worked up.</p>
<p>After my Father retired from the Agency, he wrote a fictional book about two CIA agents and he did extensive research. As part of the research he contacted a Russian embassy / consulate for information or maybe a quote for the dust cover of the book. I will not say the method he used to contact the Russians, but all espionage agents are aware that the CIA / NSA monitors that channel.</p>
<p><strong>One year later</strong> as my Dad was finishing up his writing and research (he was self-publishing it, a one man show) and getting ready to submit the manuscript to the Agency's <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v41i3a01p.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PRB (Publication Review Board)</a> when a couple of Federal agents came to his office suite and questioned the suite receptionist when my Dad was not there. The receptionist was in charge of taking phone calls, distributing mail, handling visitors, booking the conference room, etc, so she was in the know.</p>
<p>Fortunately my Dad befriended the receptionist years earlier and she was his eyes and ears around the building. So, when the Feds started informally questioning her about my Dad and his dealings at the office, she finally said "enough, that my Dad was one of the good guys, ex Marine, ex ATF Fed, ex CIA and was never involved with anything shady". The Feds finally left my Dad's office building and she called my Dad and filled him in on all the details of what happened.</p>
<p>My Dad took action and called the Feds and said to come to my office and let's chat about what you really want and why you were sniffing around for information. They had a meeting at his office and they admitted that they were following up to see if my Dad had been "turned" and was giving the Russians any secrets. My Dad knew that his contact with the Russians triggered this response.</p>
<p>What blew his and my minds was it took <strong>one year</strong> for the Feds to finally come around to see if my Dad had gone "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Agee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philip Agee</a>" on them. (ex CIA Agent and traitor that fled to Cub, who wrote a detailed book about his time at the CIA, revealing tons of secrets)</p>
<p>So my experiences led me to disbelieve what Colby said on the radio, that the Agency had a handle on former Agents.</p>
<p>If you have read any of my posting on my Dad's training and qualification, he was not a desk jockey at Langley reading reports and doing analysis.</p>
<p>He has a highly skilled and trained TOPS (special designation) Agent that did surveillance, wiretapping, lock picking, covert photography, bypass security systems, "black bag" jobs of entering embassies, consulates, and bedrooms of enemy countries / agents and open safes, take pictures, plant bugs, etc. He would have been a highly prized target for a foreign intelligence service to be able to turn him.</p>
<p>So back to Colby and the radio show.</p>
<p>I called in and got through right away to the live radio show and I had a strategy behind what I did next.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">I validated myself as a CIA insider by recalling and telling the Snoopy and Red Barron cable story and he laughed out loud and he told the radio host that was totally true and a very interesting experience.</p>
<p>I knew I had him. Then I hit him the short version of the Feds showing up after a year, which contradicted what he had just said about the Agency's diligence on watching for moles and defectors. There was a brief muffed chat between Colby and the radio host, then the radio host basically blew me off and Colby said, next caller...</p>

                <h2 id="mcetoc_1dcnf1ibu0">Blowing Up Moonshine Stills</h2>
<p>My Dad’s first job for the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) as a Federal agent was based in North Carolina where his job was to interdict illegal stills of moonshine and shiners transporting the moonshine in very fast cars. The government taxes all alcohol and they want their cut, hence the name - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/revenuers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Definition of the word Revenuers">Revenuers</a>.</p>
<p>Trying to catch a shiner was a game of cat and mouse.  They hid their stills deep in the mountains on roads that were not on a map.  They would also buy a decrepit old car and put a Cadillac engine into it along with a large stainless steel tank in the trunk to hold the moonshine.  If my Dad was working the back roads of North Carolina and came upon a suspected shiner driving, the race was on and most the time they won.  He had to build up an intelligence network to discover where the stills were hidden.</p>
<p>My Dad used to carry sticks of dynamite in the trunk of his car to blow up the stills.  This was the old fashion kind of dynamite that sweated nitroglycerin, making it very unstable.</p>
<p>One time he located a large still near a shiners house and placed his dynamite at the base of the large copper kettles.  He discovered that he used too much dynamite and the kettles ignited like rockets going to the Moon but instead they flew high in the sky towards the house of the shiner.  When they landed they exploded in a giant fireball, barely missing the house.</p>
<p>He was very happy that he did not have to write a Dear Director letter explaining why he blew up a citizen’s house.</p>
<p>To be sneaky the shiners would drive by our house and see if my Dad’s car was home.  If it was they knew it was safe to make a run.</p>
<p>My Mother was not too happy because I used to play out in the front yard as a kid and here were these criminals hanging around, putting us under surveillance.</p>

<p><br>Savannakhet is an extra sleepy little town that sits on the banks of the Mekong river, about midway down the left side of Laos.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dcppkluo4"> Taking a swim</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannakhet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannakhet</a></p>
<p>The <strong>Mekong river is not a sanitary place to swim in</strong>, much less drink the river water or eat the catfish that are caught there. I believe that is an understatement.<br><br>The local Laotians do not understand the concept of cross-contamination of a water source that brings life to the whole ecosystem.<br><br>The Mekong is life for Laos, and transportation, food source, laundry mat, and dumping ground. As is so many things in Laos, it is a contradiction in itself. The dumping included human waste, trash, and dead bodies - human and animal.<br><br>So many NGO's (Non-Government Organizations) tried to educate and help the locals understand and deal with the consequences of their actions of not protecting the Mekong. <br><br>During the Vietnam war and the Secret war, battles up stream could leave people and cargo to float downstream.<br><br>The Mekong is similar to the Mississippi river in that it is a long and very critical waterway. The Mekong upstream starts in the Tibetan Plateau then runs through China's Yunnan Province, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, with the terminal point the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.<br><br>So one day my Mom decided to take me and my Brother down to Savannakhet, to visit some of her friends. We jumped on the latest Air America Milk run plane [story] and flew down to Savannakhet.<br><br>The friends had a few kids my age and since it was very boring, and left to our own devices, we left the Savannakhet house and decided to go swimming in the Mekong. Mind you back at home in Vientiane, we would never have been let to do that, for safety and heath reasons.<br><br>So we get to the Mekong, on a typical hot sweaty humid day and waded out into the Mekong. We messed around for about <strong>two hours</strong> and then got hungry and tired of the sun, so we packed up and went back to the Savannakhet house.<br><br>My poor Mom was so upset when she discovered where we had been, she could hard speak. No worse for the wear, after a day of going to the movie theater and just being a sack of rice, we left and flew back to Vientiane uneventfully.<br><br>We never spoke about it again.<br><br>Years later when I learned the truth about the river, I know that me and my Brother got lucky that nothing happened to us.<br><br></p>

<p><br>This was the flag of Laos from 1952-1975. Laos had a huge population of elephants that they used as a construction vehicle like the West uses a John Deere tractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Country of Laos</a><br><br>Laos is a land locked, poor country that was a springboard for CIA operations during the Vietnam War. The Agency built the largest private airline in the world to support the “Secret War”. That airline was called Air America (AA). It predecessor was Civil Air Transport (CAT) Airlines. <br><br>The Agency also hired and supplied a mercenary army of about 30,000 troops and used them to attack and harass the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail (HCMT) and the Communist troops that used Laos and Cambodia as a sanctuary. The Communists recruited indigenous people of Laos and they were called Pathet Lao (PL). <br><br>The country of Laos is approximated the size of Utah and is mostly mountains and plateaus. The climate is tropical, with a rainy season from May to November and the dry season from December to April. It floods about 6 feet every seven years, so the local villagers build their huts on 9-10 foot stilts.<br><br>We were stationed in <strong>Vientiane</strong>, the capital, for two long years, from 1968-1969. This time period was the height of the battles in Vietnam, B-52 bombings, and misery in Southeast Asia (SEA).<br><br>For an excellent article about Air America (AA) in Laos, please click on this link Supporting the <br><br>"Secret War": CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974. <br><br>This article on the CIA web site by William M.
